### Bug Fixes

* add the bin to the files array explicitly ([7b522cc](https://github.com/bcoe/toml-to-env/commit/7b522cc))
* I guess files stanza doesn't like relative paths ([cf56684](https://github.com/bcoe/toml-to-env/commit/cf56684))
* switch TOML parser, which adheres closer to the spec ([#1](https://github.com/bcoe/toml-to-env/issues/1)) ([dfc9223](https://github.com/bcoe/toml-to-env/commit/dfc9223))


### Features
